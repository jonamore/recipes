# Spring Creek Rolls - (https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/buttery-sourdough-buns-recipe)

### Dough
- 1/2 cup (113g) sourdough starter, ripe (fed) or discard
- 3 cups (361g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1 tablespoon (14g) sugar
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 large egg
- 5 tablespoons (71g) soft butter
- 2/3 cup (152g) lukewarm water

### Directions
1. Combine all of the dough ingredients in a large bowl, and mix and knead — using your hands, a stand mixer, or a bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, smooth dough.
1. Place the dough in a lightly greased container — an 8-cup measure works well here — and allow the dough to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until it's just about doubled in bulk.
1. Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface.
1. Roll and pat the dough into a rough rectangle approximately 1" thick. Spread the dough with some melted butter.
1. Cut dough into squares about 2x2"
1. Lightly grease two 8" or 9" round cake pans. 
1. Cover the pans, and let the buns rise for 60 minutes, until they're noticeably puffy. Don't let these buns rise too long; you want them to have enough rising power left to expand nicely in the oven. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.
1. Uncover the pans, and brush each bun with some of the remaining melted butter.
1. Bake the buns for 22 to 25 minutes; they'll color only slightly.
1. Remove the buns from the oven, and turn them out of the pan onto a rack. Brush with any remaining melted butter. Serve hot or warm. To reheat, place the buns on a baking sheet, tent lightly with aluminum foil, and bake for 10 minutes in a preheated 350°F oven.
1. Wrap any leftover buns airtight, and store at room temperature for several days. For longer storage, wrap airtight and freeze.
